            The Internet of Things is a fast growing industry that can be divided into 
            several categories: consumer, commercial, and industrial. When we think of IoT 
            as a consumer, we may think of a refrigerator telling us when we're out of milk, 
            but that's not what makes IoT revolutionary. Instead, the fridge should be able 
            to collect energy usage and generate data from all across the grid, then utilize 
            this data to figure out how to best distribute energy resources to optimize overall 
            energy consumption, benefiting both consumers and the utility companies. Let's take a 
            look at four aspects directly related to the future of IoT.

                <h2>IOT INFLUENCE IN BUSINESS</h2>
                <p> 
                    IoT is creating a buzz around the world. It has impacted mobile app development industries in such 
                    a way that various organizations are integrating IoT into applications to ensure improvised user experiences. 
                    Whether healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, or retail, every business looks forward to IoT solutions for 
                    communicating with intelligent devices, vehicle controls, tracking, and logistics. The ultimate goal of 
                    choosing IoT apps is to improve productivity and leave abundant opportunities for growth and development. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is evident that businesses are moving towards IoT mobile app development to grow their business rapidly.
                    With IoT technology, your business can use every data point to achieve growth goals and optimize processes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    IoT solutions also streamline existing processes across manufacturing, supply chain, production, and other industries. 
                    Streamlined operations minimize downtime and decrease costs. The manufacturing industry is the best example of cost 
                    reduction via IoT technology.

                    <h2>IOT SMART CITIES</h2>
                    <p>
                        A smart city is usually defined as a city that uses IoT and ICT (information and communications technology) 
                        to enhance infrastructure and services provided to citizens and businesses. In addition, a smart city can help people access 
                        information quicker. A smart city uses several technologies, such as IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), software solutions, 
                        communication networks, and more. IoT is the key to turning a city into a smart city. IoT is a system of several connected devices, 
                        such as sensors, vehicles, and home appliances. IoT devices can communicate and transfer data via the internet without any human 
                        intervention. An IoT smart city also utilizes edge computing, creating an edge computing smart city. Edge computing brings compute power 
                        closer to an IoT device to save bandwidth and reduce latency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Key characteristics of a smart city or IoT smart city are:
                        Smart city infrastructure based on advanced technology,
                        Environmental friendly initiatives,
                        Smart public transport system,
                        Integrated urban planning,
                        *Ability to allow citizens to interact with smart city ecosystems, connected buildings, mobile devices, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        IoT-based devices produce a lot of data. Hence, they need a place to store this data, but these devices usually 
                        have limited storage, performance capabilities, and power supplies. This is where cloud computing comes in.
