            These days, our heads are all in the cloud. And like the clouds above us, a few formations 
            and patterns have begun to prevail. However, unlike clouds in the sky, the shapes in cloud computing 
            trends look an awful lot like what we have seen in tech over the past decade. Seven years ago, 
            Uber began redefining transit, especially in urban areas. Next came food delivery services, which became 
            very popular during the pandemic. Now, we are seeing this on-demand model transmute into a variety of cloud-based services. 
            On-demand logic translates handily into the computing space. Unless you're a billionaire, 
            it's unlikely that you have the resources to pay for a private driver who waits for you 
            and/or brings you food. For the rest of us, we turn to interfaces like Uber and DoorDash 
            to get driving or delivery services on demand. Not only is it more affordable, but it's also 
            just more practical and available exactly (and only) when you need it.

                <h2>ClOUD COMPUTING IN BIG DATA</h2>
                <p>
                    Big Data Analytics makes up the second leg of the Next Internet. In spite of the proliferation of fancy new titles, 
                    like data science professional, that fuel enthusiasm for Big Data, there is very little that a social scientist would 
                    find novel. It generally involves taking a large, often massive, and almost always, quantitative data set, and examining 
                    the specific ways the data do or do not cohere or correlate, in order to draw conclusions about current behavior and attitudes 
                    and go on to make predictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Facebook, for example, takes the data generated by its 1.3 billion or so users and relates the likes associated with posts about 
                    everything from celebrities, companies, and politicians to views about society, products (and, of course, cats). 
                    These enable the company to develop profiles on its subscribers that are then sold to marketers who are able to target 
                    Facebook users with customized ads sent to their Facebook pages. Google does the same for search topics as well as for the 
                    content of Gmail, and Amazon creates profiles of its users based on searches and purchases on its site. Given the limitations 
                    of quantitative correlational analysis, especially the absence of context, theory, and subjectivity (qualitative data is ignored 
                    or poorly translated into numbers), such analysis is not always accurate and incidents of Big Data failures, on such projects as 
                    seasonal flu forecasting and building models for economic development, are mounting, as are the opportunities to make mischief 
                    with data for profit (Mosco 2014). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The massively large stores of data available for analysis in the digital factories that make up the Cloud, offer major incentives 
                    for companies and governments to invest in both Cloud data centers and in Big Data analysis. It is reasonable to be concerned that 
                    singular reliance on Big Data in research is paving the way for what one might call digital positivism.

                    <h2>USING CLOUD COMPUTING FOR QUANTOM COMPUTING</h2>
                    <p>
                        Quantum computing is changing the business world in unprecedented ways. Companies like Google promote 
                        innovation by leveraging quantum physics principles to develop next-generation end-user products. 
                        Supercomputers are the best example of how quantum computing works when used correctly. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, and AWS compete by adapting to the emerging quantum technologies. 
                        Quantum computers employ the principles of quantum physics to enable complex algorithmic calculations and 
                        process large data sets in a short amount of time. A supercomputer can provide powerful encryption capabilities 
                        for electronic communications and increase network security. Financial institutions can leverage quantum computing 
                        to speed up their transaction processes. This approach saves time and increases process efficiency.
                        Quantum computers store data in qubits, a simpler form of data that speeds up processing. 
                        Quantum computing also reduces the additional cost of creating new resources to handle pre-optimized tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cloud computing and networking rely on other software technologies such as hypervisors, which manage how a computer 
                        is divided up into several virtual machines, and routing protocols to send data over the network. In fact, research 
                        is underway to develop each of these for the quantum internet. With quantum computer operating systems still under development, 
                        it is difficult to develop a hypervisor to run multiple operating systems on the same quantum computer as a classical hypervisor would.
