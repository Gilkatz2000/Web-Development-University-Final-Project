            You might think you've experienced VR, and you might have been pretty impressed. 
            Particularly if you're a gamer, there are some great experiences to be had out 
            there (or rather, in there) today.  But over the next few years, in VR, as in all 
            fields of technology, we're going to see things that make what is cutting-edge today 
            look like Space Invaders. And although the games will be amazing, the effects of this 
            transformation will be far broader, touching on our work, education, and social lives.

                <h2>VR IN EDUCATION</h2>
                <p>
                    The traditional educational process means a dry presentation of facts and putting theory into practice. 
                    Many generations have learned according to this “golden” formula. But there is one problem: this model 
                    doesn't take into account the individual characteristics of students.
                    Those with poor academic performance cannot memorize large amounts of information.  
                    Some schoolchildren are visual learners: it is important for them to “see” the object of study, and not just hear or read about it.
                    That is why teachers evaluate VR as a universal educational method that can interest students, regardless of their abilities and hobbies. 
                    Let's look into the future of VR in education, which is gradually becoming a reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modern schoolchildren and students are accustomed to games and entertainment, with levels, points, and rewards. 
                    They are more interested in playing than listening to their teachers. Teaching techniques that worked 50 years ago 
                    are ineffective for today's students. Educators can either struggle against technologies or use them to their advantage 
                    to teach kids more productively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to one survey, even back in 2018, 18% of US educational institutions fully deployed VR, and 46% of colleges employed VR 
                    in some form on campus. So, it's clear that the prospects for this technology are stunning. XR experts believe the education and healthcare 
                    industries are leaders in the use of immersive technologies. VR in education  is forecast to be a $700 million market by 2025. 
                    Fortune Business Insights even predicts that the VR in education market will grow from $656 million in 2018 to $13 billion in 2026.

                    <h2>VR IN HEALTH CARE</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the biggest problems in healthcare right now is that patients are not able to fully engage in care because they feel 
                        scared or anxious about undergoing physical therapy for their injury or illness. This article talks about 
                        how VR could help improve patient engagement using an avatar made of soft foam that mimics the shape of a patient's body. 
                        It also discusses how VR could be used to train health care professionals on how to better interact with their patients and create 
                        a positive therapeutic environment for them during treatment sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        VR and other immersive technologies are being used in a variety of ways in healthcare. They have the potential to improve patient 
                        education, training and other aspects of care.
                        The use of VR in healthcare is not limited to professional training, though. Many patients have reported that they have enjoyed 
                        using virtual reality. This is because it allows them to experience a more realistic environment with more interesting sensations 
                        than what they're used to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, virtual reality isn't yet a standard part of most physicians' arsenals. VR headsets are still crude, and image quality 
                        can't compete with the real world. In addition, headsets suffer from nonintuitive user interfaces and can pose health risks like 
                        dizziness, says Rema Padman, who studies VR as a professor of management science and health care informatics at Carnegie Mellon 
                        University's Heinz College. “In particular, the hardware limitations of headsets and accompanying software and tools pose challenges 
                        for clinicians using VR in surgery,” Padman says. “Similarly, there are limitations in terms of prolonged use for patients, especially 
                        those who are vulnerable or frail, such as children and the elderly.” Despite these drawbacks, virtual reality holds a lot of promise.
